<figcaption>Matters Lab is pleased to announce the partnership with Numbers Protocol to empower the creator economy in an unprecedented way.</figcaption>

**As we congratulate Numbers Protocol for winning the [2023 #MetaVerse & Web3  championship of the 15th South by Southwest® (SXSW®) Pitch event](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sxsw-announces-winners-2023-pitch-014900147.html?guccounter=2),  [Matters Lab ](http://matters-lab.io)is very proud to announce our ecosystem partnership with Numbers Protocol, a decentralized technology service provider that makes digital media traceable and verifiable.**

Matters Lab’s mission is to create a freer and fairer creator ecosystem through the next evolution of the Internet, Web3. The primary product, [Matters.Town](http://matters.town), is a Web3 social media ecosystem using decentralization tools to protect digital rights, design a self-governing system and community, and invent models for a new creator economy. We have built the largest open-source decentralized publishing platform in the Web3 world with more than 100,000 content creators.

Numbers Protocol brings integrity and authenticity to the digital content by creating a decentralized photo network using NFT technology. Digital content assets are both traceable and verifiable through our innovative Capture, Seal, and Trace process, allowing users to monetize what they have created. Numbers Protocol recognizes that digital content will be a big part of Web 3.0 and positions itself to be a pioneer in the space by providing transparency and user-friendly tools to create traceable and verifiable digital assets.

Both Matters Lab and Numbers Protocol built their decentralized content ecosystem on top of an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system that is hard for authorities to censor, allowing creators to be genuinely dependent.

Matters Lab and Numbers Protocol are aligned in the same vision to empower the creator economy. We intend to collaborate and streamline the content writing process, from creation to monetization, while emphasizing content authenticity as a core value to be embedded in product development. Numbers Protocol’s technology will be integrated into Matters.Town to co-develop and embed web 3.0 features to extend the user journey toward traceable digital assets and veracity.

The partnership demonstrates how technology can be a powerful force in supporting global content creators on their creative journey. We are excited about the future we build together and how much we can empower the creator economy in an unprecedented way.
