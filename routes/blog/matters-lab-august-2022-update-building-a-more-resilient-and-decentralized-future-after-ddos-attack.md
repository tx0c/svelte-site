> The DDoS attack is perhaps the best reminder that it is time to move on to the next chapter with decentralization. This requires the collaboration of different products and communities.

Since July 28th, Matters.News has been targeted by DDoS Attacks for over two weeks long. The IPs that launched the attack were located worldwide, mainly in the United States, Indonesia, India, Germany, and Singapore. The attack lasted during UTC+8 working hours, peaking at 4 million requests per second.

For a decentralized content platform supporting beleaguered independent writers, such an attack was more or less expected, although we could not have anticipated the scale of the attack.

DDoS attacks are used to overload the server with a large number of requests, preventing users from using the service normally. Therefore, all users’ data, content and assets are not affected. Upon discovering DDoS attacks, [the team quickly upgraded the firewall](https://matters.news/@hi176/315911-matters-news-%E7%B6%B2%E7%AB%99%E5%8D%B3%E6%97%A5%E8%B5%B7%E6%81%A2%E5%BE%A9%E6%AD%A3%E5%B8%B8%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8-2022-08-10-bafyreifbpics5y7yustbw4wgdbopbud2vydugia3jomimds2urd6swps2a) and migrated [Matters.News](http://matters.news/) within 48 hours. The team has put the site back in service since August 10th. Because of the security upgrade, website might be unstable shortly. Thank you for your patience.

We have now [prepared a response mechanism to minimize the impact of the attack on user experience](https://matters.news/@hi176/325908-%E6%BC%B8%E9%80%B2%E5%BC%8F%E5%8E%BB%E4%B8%AD%E5%BF%83%E5%8C%96-d-do-s-%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6%E5%BE%A9%E7%9B%A4%E8%88%87%E9%9F%8C%E6%80%A7%E5%85%A7%E5%AE%B9%E7%B6%B2%E7%B5%A1%E5%85%B1%E5%BB%BA-bafyreia4mwpjuuht7qphrsz55xrkse7il2rbr6w5ebomc6jbw4ff2zmuuq). We will also compile the data of the attack and share it in the near future as a case study for Web3 information security.
